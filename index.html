						I have been working in restaurants, film, and media for the last decade. 
                        This is a new chapter in my life and I am seeking new skills and employment. 
                        We purchased a small farm in Maiden Rock, WI and have been running a CSA. 
                        Farming is not a career on the small scale though, so it's time for something new. 
                        I get things done right, on time, and take pride in being reliable.
